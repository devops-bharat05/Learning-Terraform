#### 6. **Exploring Backend Configurations for State File Security**

   **Objective**: Configure an encrypted S3 bucket backend and explore securing sensitive data within the state file.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Set up an S3 bucket with default encryption enabled and integrate it as a backend.
     2. In your Terraform code, add sensitive data (like an RDS instance password) as a variable.
     3. Configure the variable to avoid displaying it in plaintext by using `sensitive = true`.
     4. Apply the configuration and observe the state file to understand how sensitive information is handled.
   
   ```hcl
   # backend.tf
   terraform {
     backend "s3" {
       bucket = "secure-bucket"
       key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
       region = "us-west-2"
       encrypt = true
     }
   }

   # variables.tf
   variable "db_password" {
     description = "Database password"
     type        = string
     sensitive   = true
   }

   # main.tf
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }

   resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
     engine         = "mysql"
     instance_class = "db.t2.micro"
     allocated_storage = 10
     name           = "example-db"
     username       = "admin"
     password       = var.db_password
   }
   ```

   - Add `db_password` to `terraform.tfvars`:
     ```hcl
     db_password = "SuperSecretPassword123!"
     ```

   **Commands**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```
- Check the state file for sensitive data handling.
- Change configurations within each workspace, and observe how each workspace has isolated state files.

   - **Key Takeaways**:
     - Securing state files by encrypting sensitive data.
     - Ensuring compliance and protecting secrets within IaC workflows.

   **Interview Points**: Discuss best practices for securing sensitive data in state files and why direct access to state files should be limited.
