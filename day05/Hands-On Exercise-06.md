#### 6. **Exploring Backend Configurations for State File Security**

   **Objective**: Configure an encrypted S3 bucket backend and explore securing sensitive data within the state file.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Set up an S3 bucket with default encryption enabled and integrate it as a backend.
     2. In your Terraform code, add sensitive data (like an RDS instance password) as a variable.
     3. Configure the variable to avoid displaying it in plaintext by using `sensitive = true`.
     4. Apply the configuration and observe the state file to understand how sensitive information is handled.

   - **Key Takeaways**:
     - Securing state files by encrypting sensitive data.
     - Ensuring compliance and protecting secrets within IaC workflows.

   **Interview Points**: Discuss best practices for securing sensitive data in state files and why direct access to state files should be limited.
